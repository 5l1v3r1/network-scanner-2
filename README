Introduction:

    Umit Interface Editor is a editor of XML of UMIT. This tool is develpment in 
    Python too like the own UMIT and using a wrapper of GTK+ : PyGTK. 
    The aim of UIE is edit the XML that generate Profile Editor and Wizard. 
    With this tool UMIT is more powerful tool and can edit on the fly your own interface, 
    adding, remove new feautures of nmap or do modifications as user wish.  


    My project is mainly in umitInterfaceEditor/ and in umitGUI ProfileManager and others modifications at umitGUI and umitCore. 
    umitInterfaceEditor is a software to run inside UMIT. So I need do a tarball of all my branch. 
    With this new tool users can manage better the options of the powerful and great nmap adding the    newest options of nmap to UMIT front-end without edit manually xml files.

    <para>If your server requires authentication, you need to toggle the
    "Server requires authentication" option, and, if your server requires
    TLS Encryption (gmail for example) you need to toggle "Use TLS Encryption"
    option.</para>

    <para>After filling all the required fields, you may click on "Apply".
    If no error dialog appeared, your new SMTP schema is created and you
    may use it in withing Scheduler now. Clicking on "OK" will do the same,
    but will close "SMTP Account Editor" afterwards. Clicking on "Close" will
    discard the schema you were creating and will close the window.</para>

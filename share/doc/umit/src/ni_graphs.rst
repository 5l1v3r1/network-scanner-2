Introduction
------------

The graphs you will find under the *Timeline* tab were created to help you,
of course. It is an easier way to visualize all changes to all your
Inventories, and you can filter some Categories and view just some others.
Selecting something on it will show all the changes in the selected range,
and will also display percentage statistics on the bar graph placed on the
top right.


Bar graph background color
--------------------------

Yet simple, it may cause confusion about its coloring.
When a selection happens the Bar's background colour changes. It uses the
colour from the Category with most changes, except if the Category is
*Nothing*. If the Category with most changes is the *Nothing*, the colour
from the next Category with most changes is selected to be used as the
background color.
The only chance to use the background color from the Category *Nothing*
is in the case that the current selection has only data for this
category.

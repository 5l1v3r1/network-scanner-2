Introduction
------------

The idea of the NSE facilitator is to provide a better integration of
Umit, Nmap and NSE in such a way that even a newbie could easilly run
and share scripts with a few clicks, instead of finding them in the web,
downloading, reading documentation to know how to use it with Nmap and
running a long command to be able to use it.

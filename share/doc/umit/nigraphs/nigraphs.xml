    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>The graphs you will find under the tab named as 'Timeline' were
    created to help you, of course. It is an easier way to visualize all
    changes to all your Inventories, also, you can filter some Categories
    and view just some others. Selecting something on it will show all the
    changes in the selected range, and will also display percentage statistics
    on the bar graph placed on the top right.</para>

    <para>This was created to explain Bar graph colour meaning.</para>

      <title>Bar graph</title>
      <para>Yet simple, it may cause confusion about its coloring. That is why
      a section was created for it. When a selection happens the Bar display
      changes its colour. It uses the colour from the Category with more 
      changes, except if the Category is 'Nothing'. If the Category with
      most changes is the 'Nothing', the colour from the next Category with 
      most changes is selected to be used as the background color.
      The only chance to use the background color from the Category 'Nothing'
      is in the case that the current selection has only data for this
      category.</para>

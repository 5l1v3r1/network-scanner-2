NSE Facilitator will provide easy script management, sharing and updating. 
It's interface will very closer (and simplifier version) to apt-get/aptitude/Synaptic 
for deb packages distribution.

Local settings will be placed in two files:
- NSE configuration (~/.umit/nseconfig)
- NSE script base (~/.umit/nsebase)

NSE CONFIGURATION
=================

Configuration file describes script sources and installation settings (currently, only
installation directory(-es))

Several sources provided:
- single local file (FILE)
  for simple file-adding from any local place
- local directory   (DIR)
  for adding directory of scripts (like default Nmap script folders, development one or etc.)
- url file          (URL)
  for simple file-sharing in Web
- url base          (URLBASE)
  for powerful many files sharing and updating thorough Web

Also installation destinations (INSTALLDIR) will be provided, if there are several
installation directories provided they will be tried in order of appearing in configuration
file.

Configuration file is a simple text file in form <type> - <path> on each line.
Sample configuration file can looks like:
INSTALLDIR /usr/share/nmap/scripts/
INSTALLDIR ~/.umit/scripts
DIR     /usr/local/share/nmap/scripts/
FILE    ~/dev/scripts/nextWorm.nse
FILE    ~/dev/scripts/nextWormGen2.nse
URLBASE http://insecure.org/scriptbase
URL     http://myfriends.org/bestScript.nse

INSTALLDIR always included DIR source facilities, so it isn't need to include
the same directory two times.

Commented lines begins from #.

This file can be easily edited by hand or by using GUI interface which will 
be provided in Umit.

NSE SCRIPT BASE
===============

Script base will have the syntax similar to deb and consists of sequence 
of scripts descriptions like:

name: Armageddon
id: Total Armageddon
description: This script begins Armageddon on all scanned hosts.
  No way to escape from them and no way to protect from them.
  .
  This is a holy script.
author: The God <god@heaven.org>
license: holy
categories: demo
rule: host

The following attributes will be supported:

attrname    default     description
-----------------------------------------------------------
name        NECESSARY   name for simple authentication one
id          same name   short description
description ""          full description
type        "nse"       script type (currently only "nse")
author      ""          author information
license     "unknown"   type of license for this script
categories  "untagged"  comma-separated list of script categories
rule        "unknown"   (port|host|unknown) applied rule
version     "0.0.0"     script version in form x.x.x
path        ""          installed path
url         ""          url to download from
size        0           file size
md5         ""          md5 hash
sha1        ""          sha1 hash
gpg         --          gpg signature

Attribute names are case insensitive, so 'Name', 'name', 'NAME' are the same.
Descriptions separated by empty lines from each other. If one needs to 
include empty line in some attribute value (like description) he must
put single dot at that line.

Local script base (~/.umit/nsebase) contains all information
about scripts accessible throw NSE configuration sources. If
some script haven't yet downloaded and installed it has empty
or no path attribute and not-empty url for downloading from.

The same database format are using for URLBASE bases.

AVAILABLE OPERATIONS
====================

RELOAD: update script base file according to current sources status, i. e.:
  * remove single file from base if it have been deleted or add it elsewhere 
  * update source directory structure
  * download actual file version from url
  * add new scripts/versions from url base
  
INSTALL: install script by name from server with url base source

INSTALLALL: install all scripts which have not yet been installed

REMOVE: remove previously installed script

UPGRADE: upgrade script by name to current actual version

UPGRADEALL: upgrade all installed scripts to actual versions

install/remove/upgrade

INTERFACE
=========

This functionality will be provided in two forms:
* command-line Python script, supported operation from previous section
* GUI tool integrated into Umit with additional editor for script sources
  and script text

CURRENT STATUS
==============

Currently GUI part have been mostly done and has all necessary components.
Now core logic according to this specification are implementing.

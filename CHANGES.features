Created higwidgets/higframe.py

Added directory umitInventory/
  umitInventory/ is holding initial tests for Inventory data handling right now.

Modified umitGUI/MainWindow.py to include a new Top-Level menu "Inventory".
  This menu includes two options "add hosts" and "view inventory", both options
  aren't doing nothing at all right now.
